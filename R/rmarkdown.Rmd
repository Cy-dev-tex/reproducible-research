```{r t-test}
data("sleep")
result <- t.test(extra ~ group, data = sleep)
```

The data was never before anylized in this way. Except in `help(t.test)`.

`r apa_print.htest(result)$full_result`

I can now assert that what I *believe* to be true
--- that there is a difference in mean between the groups ---
is `r ifelse(result$p.value > .025, "**not**", "")` supported by data.
