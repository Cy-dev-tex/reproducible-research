Literate Programming
: Interwoven text and computer code that together forms a dynamically generated, human-readable document.
: Example: One document that includes text that describes a statistical test, code that is used to execute the statistical and the output of the code in the same document.

Version Control
: The management of change of documents/code.
: Example: Changes of the analysis code or even single parameters are documented both at development and post-publication.

Dependency Tracking
: How different parts of a manuscript/analysis relate and how these dependencies resolve via execution of code.
: Example: The manuscript depends on the statistical analysis, which depends on a preprocessing pipeline, which depends on a certain subset of the data.

Containerization
: A virtual computational environment that does encapsulate all needed software. More formally called operating-system-level virtualization.
: Example: A statistical analysis depends on the used statistical software and a virtual machine bundles them together.
